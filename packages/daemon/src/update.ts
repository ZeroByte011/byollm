/**
 * Updating byollm in place, and being able to take it back — B053.
 *
 * Ruled 2026-09-02 (016 §Auto-update): the supervisor is the home, there is
 * no second runner, and the daemon learns the version on a channel it already
 * polls. What that ruling stresses, and what this module is mostly made of,
 * is one sentence: **an updater must be able to un-update.**
 *
 * ## The order is the safety
 *
 * Drain, install, re-register, canary, and only then keep it. Each step
 * exists because skipping it breaks something specific:
 *
 * - **Drain** — finish the running job, claim nothing new. `shutdown` was
 *   the nearest existing behaviour and it is the wrong one: it cancels the
 *   active jobs and releases the leases, so updating would mean killing work
 *   somebody was waiting on. An update is elective; a job is not.
 * - **Exact version, never a tag.** `npm i -g byollm@latest` inside an
 *   updater means the fleet installs whatever the tag points at by the time
 *   each machine gets around to it — different machines, different builds,
 *   one version number in the logs. {@link exactVersion} refuses anything
 *   that is not a literal version, and that refusal is the reason it exists.
 * - **Forward only** — B360. A version at or below the running one is
 *   refused, and so is a pair this cannot order. An offer is a claim about
 *   what is newer, and a downgrade is how a machine is walked back onto a
 *   release with a known hole in it.
 * - **Provenance before it runs** — B360. After npm installs and before
 *   anything starts the new binary, the package's SLSA provenance must say
 *   our release workflow built these exact bytes (`provenance.ts`). A
 *   package that fails is rolled back without ever having been executed.
 * - **Canary by identity, not liveness.** The check is "does the installed
 *   binary say it is the version we asked for", not "does it start". A
 *   half-finished install that leaves the old binary in place starts
 *   perfectly.
 * - **Rollback**, which is the same install run with the version we came
 *   from. Kept as a value rather than discovered later: after a bad install
 *   the machine can no longer be asked what it used to be.
 *
 * ## What it does when it cannot fix itself
 *
 * A failed rollback is not retried and not hidden. It reports, loudly, on
 * the owner's surfaces and stops — a loop here is a machine that reinstalls
 * npm packages forever, and the honest end state is a daemon that says what
 * happened and leaves the machine to a person.
