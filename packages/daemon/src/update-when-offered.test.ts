/**
 * A version that is always newer than the one running.
 *
 * Every fixture in this file needs "an offer above ours", and three of them
 * spelled it as a literal — which stops being true the day the product ships
 * that number. It did: `0.1.0-alpha.98` broke two of these tests on the .98
 * cut, for reasons unrelated to anything they assert.
 *
 * **The dynamic form broke too, at the 0.1.0 cut, and worse.** It was
 * `${DAEMON_VERSION}.1`, which is valid semver only while the version is a
 * prerelease: `0.1.0-alpha.103.1` parses, `0.1.0.1` does not. An offer that
 * does not parse is never newer, so `watchForUpdate` never took it and never
 * returned — `for (;;)` with nothing to end it. **The whole file hung rather
 * than failed**, which took a full CI run to see and read on a laptop as the
 * machine dying.
 *
 * So this bumps the numeric core and drops any prerelease, which is above
 * both shapes: `0.1.0-alpha.103` and `0.1.0` both yield `0.1.1`. A fixture
 * whose validity depends on the SHAPE of the version is a fixture that breaks
 * at a cut, which is the one moment nobody wants to be reading this file.
