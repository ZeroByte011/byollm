/**
 * A job cannot read a file outside its scratch directory — proved against the
 * real binaries. Private report BY-01.
 *
 * **What was wrong, and why nothing here caught it.** `process-class.test.ts`
 * asserts that a hostile payload reaches the model verbatim and produces a
 * byte-identical argv, and it does that against `probe-backend.mjs`, which
 * reports its argv and exits. That is a faithful probe of the *spawn*, and it
 * is structurally incapable of finding a hole in the CLI's *input handling*:
 * the probe has no input preprocessor, so a payload that the real binary would
 * expand looks, to the probe, exactly like a payload it would not. The corpus
 * has carried `@/etc/passwd` from the beginning and the suite went green on it
 * every time.
 *
 * The real `claude` expands `@`-file mentions before the model turn, in its own
 * preprocessor rather than through a tool — so `--tools ""` never touched it.
 * The empty scratch `cwd` stopped relative mentions only, and `HOME` is in the
 * child's environment by design, so `@/absolute/path` and `@~/path` both
 * resolved and came back in the answer. Any site the owner had paired with
 * could name a file and be told its contents.
 *
 * **So this file runs the binaries.** Its shape is the one
 * `codex-tools-disabled.test.ts` established and this row sharpens in three
 * places:
 *
 * 1. **The control comes first and decides whether anything was proved.** A
 *    model asked to read a file it cannot read says "CANNOT", and a model that
 *    *can* read it will sometimes say "CANNOT" anyway — measured, on the first
 *    `@~/` probe of this investigation, which refused once and then leaked the
 *    canary on the next three identical runs. So a guarded run that returns no
 *    canary is evidence of nothing until the same prompt, with the containment
 *    flag removed, has leaked it in this session, on this machine, against this
 *    CLI version. When the control does not leak, this reports **inconclusive**
 *    rather than a pass.
 * 2. **The guarded side is the shipped backend, not a copy of it.** It calls
 *    `ClaudeCliBackend.execute`, so the argv, the environment allowlist and the
 *    scratch `cwd` are the ones a real job gets. Only the control — which by
 *    definition is not the shipped configuration — is hand-spawned here.
 * 3. **It is default-on, and loud when it does not run.** A skipped security
 *    check is how a guarantee rots, and `expect(true, "did not run")` does not
 *    print: a passing assertion's message is never shown. So the skip goes out
 *    through `console.warn`, which the reporter does print.
