/**
 * A cloud-lane job that takes longer than one lease still gets delivered —
 * B258, from Kevin's read of the docs against a real integration.
 *
 * ## The chain, verified in source before this was written
 *
 * On the cloud lane the site adopts the relay's lease at claim time with
 * `expiresAt = claim.leaseExpiresAt` (`cloud.ts:346`). The device then
 * heartbeats **the relay**, and the relay renews — but `renewLeases` is called
 * from exactly one place in this package, `handlers.ts:494`, which is the
 * DIRECT lane's heartbeat handler. A cloud-lane site therefore never hears
 * that the lease was renewed.
 *
 * Its own sweep expires the lease at claim + `LEASE_MS` (`memory.ts:457`) and
 * requeues the row. When the device's result finally arrives, `complete`
 * refuses it: `job.lease?.id === args.holder.leaseId` is false against a job
 * whose lease is now `null` (`memory.ts:293`).
 *
 * `LEASE_MS` defaults to **60 000**. Sixty seconds is shorter than a great
 * deal of LLM generation, and the cloud lane is the one the docs teach —
 * Kevin's case is book translation, where this is the difference between
 * shipping a chapter and shipping half of one without knowing.
 *
 * ## Why this models the pump rather than driving it
 *
 * The pump's own path seals and verifies a real envelope, so driving it end to
 * end would spend the case on crypto that is not what broke. These are the
 * four store calls the pump makes, in the order it makes them, with the clock
 * moved between them — which is exactly where the defect lives and nowhere
 * else.
 *
 * ## Over both stores — BY-05
 *
 * B258 was fixed in MemoryStore and nowhere else: the Supabase adapter's
 * sweep is a SQL function, and it kept requeueing adopted leases for another
 * month because every case here ran against the reference store only. So
 * each case runs once per adapter, and the Postgres one runs in the CI job
 * that starts a local stack (`freeze-gate-postgres`), which sets
 * `REQUIRE_SUPABASE` so a stack that failed to start cannot pass as memory.
 *
 * Postgres reads `now()` and that clock cannot be faked. The harness clock
 * starts at wall time there, and moving it forward moves the job's own
 * timestamps BACK by the same amount before the sweep runs — the one row
 * under test sees exactly the time it would have seen. What cannot be had is
 * one-millisecond resolution across a network round trip, so the boundary
 * case steps a store-specific {@link StoreCase.tick} rather than 1 ms.
